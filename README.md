## Description

This application was created to generate random passwords based on criteria selected by the user. It can be run in your browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Usage

To generate a random password, click the generate password button. A window prompt will appear asking you how many characters you'd like your password to be. Enter how many characters you would like (or hit cancel to end the interaction and close the prompt) and two more dialog boxes will appear asking you whether you'd like to include special characters and uppercase letters in your password. After making your choices, a password with all your criteria will appear in the box.
